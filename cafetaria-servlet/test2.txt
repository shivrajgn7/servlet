1) what is the role of instaneof operator? give example
:it's a type comparison operator returning Boolean value

2)how does java handle multiple inheritance using interfaces illustrate with an example
:java class doesn't allow multiple inheritance , we can do single, multilevel, hierarchy inheritance 
	but using interface the class can implements more than one implements
 ex->class BUS implements Redbus,Abhibus{
		@Override
		void book(){
		System.out.println("Seat is allocated");
		}

	}
3)What is dynamic binding? how is it different from static binding?
: dynamic binding is runtime polymorphism its it use method overriding if want to do any changes in 
	parent class we have to override the methos but same method name same  parameter list same type we can give different return type

*static binding is a compile time polymorphism it use to achive method overloading it same method name different parameter list we can 
give different or same type


4)explain how this and super keywords are used in java with example
: this keyword is refers the current class of object fields, this keyword is only use in constructor or instance method
 ex: class Laptop{
	int id;
	String name;
	Laptop(){
	this.name="Lenovo";
	this.id=568
	}
	}
	
	*super keyword is refers the parent of object we have to mention before this keyword
	
5)what is constructor overloading? how does it different from method over loading
: constructor overloading is same name as class name we have to give different parameter list
* its a different from method overloading because constructor overloading doesn't have return type and its a special method

6)Illustrate with an example for upcasting and downcasting in heritance?
:


7)how do default and static methods in interfaces enhance abstraction?
:default methods is we can give body in a abstract method
	*static method is doesn't have body its a abstract method 
	ex: default void taken(){
	}
8)what is different between IS-A and HAS-A relation in OOP?
: IS-A relationship is inheriting one class to derived or subclass
	it is the concept of inheritance
	* every class Implicitly extends Object class
	*inheritance is 3 types 
		single inheritance
		multilevel inheritance
		Hierarchy inheritance
HAS-A relationship has a relationship between two or more class called as has a relation
	Association
	Composition: its a loose coupling
	Aggregation: its have tight coupling

9)write a program to illustrate dynamic method dispatch in java



10)write a program to demonstrate multiple interfaces implementation
: public interface VRL{
	public void selectPlace();
	}

	public interface KSRTC{
		public void price();
	}
	
public class BookMyShoowImpl implements VRL,KSRTC{
	public static void main(String[]args){
	
	void selectPlace(){
		System.out.println("Shimoga");
	}
	void price(){
		Systemm.out.pritln(500);
	}
   }
}


11)Different between Collection and Collections in java
: Collection is an interface its a container it is structured 
	*Collections is a collecting all impl methods to collection is called collections

12)Explain difference between list,set and map
